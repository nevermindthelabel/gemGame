#Unit 4 Gem Game

https://nevermindthelabel.github.io/gemGame/

### Overview

In this assignment, you'll create another fun and interactive game for web browsers. This time, your app must dynamically update your HTML pages with the jQuery library.

### Technology and Libraries used

I used [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) to dynamically update the HTML on the index.html page, and a little CSS for the  styling of various elements within the page. Seeing a mostly blank HTML page come alive with the help of jQuery was awesome.
