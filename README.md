[GitHub](https://nevermindthelabel.github.io/gemGame) pages link.

### Overview

In this project, you'll create another fun and interactive game for web browsers. This time, your app must dynamically update your HTML pages with the jQuery library.

### Technology and Libraries used

Using [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) to dynamically update the HTML on the index.html page, and a little CSS for the  styling of various elements within the page. Seeing a mostly blank HTML page come alive with the help of jQuery was awesome.
